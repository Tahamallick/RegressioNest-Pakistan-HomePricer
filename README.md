# RegressioNest-Pakistan-HomePricer 

This repository contains the code for building a real estate price prediction website. The project is divided into three main components:

1. **Model Building**: Using the Banglore home prices dataset from Kaggle.com, we construct a predictive model using Scikit-learn and linear regression.

2. **Flask Server**: A Python Flask server is developed to utilize the trained model and serve HTTP requests.

3. **Website**: The front-end interface is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing users to input home square footage, number of bedrooms, etc., and obtain the predicted price by calling the Flask server.

## Key Features and Concepts Covered
- Data loading and cleaning
- Outlier detection and removal
- Feature engineering
- Dimensionality reduction
- GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning
- K-fold cross-validation

## Technologies and Tools Used
1. Python
2. Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3. Matplotlib for data visualization
4. Scikit-learn for model building
5. Jupyter Notebook
6. Python Flask for HTTP server

Feel free to explore the code and adapt it for your own real estate prediction projects!
